MUDBLOODS AND MURMURS Harry spent a lot of time over the next few days 
dodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy 
Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder to avoid 
was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized 
Harry’s schedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a 
bigger thrill than to say, “All right, Harry?” six or 
seven times a day and hear, “Hello, Colin,” back, 
however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it. Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the 
disasterous car journey and Ron’s wand was still 
malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning 
by shooting out of Ron’s hand in Charms and hitting 
tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, 
creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had 
struck. So with one thing and another, Harry was 
quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and 
Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday 
morning. Harry, however, was shaken awake several 
hours earlier than he would have liked by Oliver 
Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets- J.K. Rowling “Whassamatter?” said Harry groggily. “Quidditch practice!” said Wood. “Come on!” Harry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist 
hanging across the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he 
was awake, he couldn’t understand how he could 
have slept through the racket the birds were making. “Oliver,” Harry croaked. “It’s the crack of dawn.” “Exactly,” said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth 
year and, at the moment, his eyes were gleaming with 
a crazed enthusiasm. “It’s part of our new training 
program. Come on, grab your broom, and let’s go,” 
said Wood heartily. “None of the other teams have 
started training yet; we’re going to be first off the 
mark this year — ” Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of 
bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes. “Good man,” said Wood. “Meet you on the field in 
fifteen minutes.” When he’d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on 
his cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron 
explaining where he’d gone and went down the spiral 
staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two 
Thousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the 
portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and 
Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral 
staircase, his camera swinging madly around his 
neck and something clutched in his hand. “I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, 
Harry! Look what I’ve got here! I’ve had it developed, I 
wanted to show you — ” Page | 117 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling Harry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was 
brandishing under his nose. A moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard 
on an arm Harry recognized as his own. He was 
pleased to see that his photographic self was putting 
up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view. 
As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and slumped, 
panting, against the white edge of the picture. “Will you sign it?” said Colin eagerly. “No,” said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that 
the room was really deserted. “Sorry, Colin, I’m in a 
hurry — Quidditch practice — ” He climbed through the portrait hole. “Oh, wow! Wait for me! I’ve never watched a Quidditch 
game before!” Colin scrambled through the hole after him. “It’ll be really boring,” Harry said quickly, but Colin 
ignored him, his face shining with excitement. “You were the youngest House player in a hundred 
years, weren’t you, Harry? Weren’t you?” said Colin, 
trotting alongside him. “You must be brilliant. I’ve 
never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own broom? Is 
that the best one there is?” Harry didn’t know how to get rid of him. It was like 
having an extremely talkative shadow. “I don’t really understand Quidditch,” said Colin 
breathlessly. “Is it true there are four balls? And two 
of them fly around trying to knock people off their 
brooms?” Page | 118 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling “Yes,” said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the 
complicated rules of Quidditch. “They’re called 
Bludgers. There are two Beaters on each team who 
carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side. 
Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.” “And what are the other balls for?” Colin asked, 
tripping down a couple of steps because he was 
gazing open-mouthed at Harry. “Well, the Quaffle — that’s the biggish red one — is 
the one that scores goals. Three Chasers on each 
team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get 
it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch — 
they’re three long poles with hoops on the end.” “And the fourth ball — ” “ — is the Golden Snitch,” said Harry, “and it’s very 
small, very fast, and difficult to catch. But that’s what 
the Seeker’s got to do, because a game of Quidditch 
doesn’t end until the Snitch has been caught. And 
whichever team’s Seeker gets the Snitch earns his 
team an extra hundred and fifty points.” “And you’re the Gryffindor Seeker, aren’t you?” said 
Colin in awe. “Yes,” said Harry as they left the castle and started 
across the dew-drenched grass. “And there’s the 
Keeper, too. He guards the goal posts. That’s it, 
really.” But Colin didn’t stop questioning Harry all the way 
down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and 
Harry only shook him off when he reached the 
changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping 
voice, “I’ll go and get a good seat, Harry!” and hurried 
off to the stands. Page | 119 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the 
changing room. Wood was the only person who looked 
truly awake. Fred and George Weasley were sitting, 
puffy-eyed and tousle-haired, next to fourth year 
Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against 
the wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell 
and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side 
opposite them. “There you are, Harry, what kept you?” said Wood 
briskly. “Now, I wanted a quick talk with you all 
before we actually get onto the field, because I spent 
the summer devising a whole new training program, 
which I really think will make all the difference. ...” Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch 
field, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and 
crosses in different-colored inks. He took out his 
wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to 
wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood 
launched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred 
Weasley’s head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet’s 
shoulder and he began to snore. The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, 
but there was another board under that, and a third 
under that one. Harry sank into a stupor as Wood 
droned on and on. “So,” said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a 
wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for 
breakfast at this very moment up at the castle. “Is 
that clear? Any questions?” “I’ve got a question, Oliver,” said George, who had 
woken with a start. “Why couldn’t you have told us all 
this yesterday when we were awake?” Wood wasn’t pleased. Page | 120 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling “Now, listen here, you lot,” he said, glowering at them 
all. “We should have won the Quidditch Cup last year. 
We’re easily the best team. But unfortunately — 
owing to circumstances beyond our control — ” Harry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been 
unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match 
of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had 
been a player short and had suffered their worst 
defeat in three hundred years. Wood took a moment to regain control of himself. 
Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him. “So this year, we train harder than ever before. ... 
Okay, let’s go and put our new theories into practice!” 
Wood shouted, seizing his broomstick and leading the 
way out of the locker rooms. Stiff-legged and still 
yawning, his team followed. They had been in the locker room so long that the 
sun was up completely now, although remnants of 
mist hung over the grass in the stadium. As Harry 
walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione 
sitting in the stands. “Aren’t you finished yet?” called Ron incredulously. “Haven’t even started,” said Harry, looking jealously 
at the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had 
brought out of the Great Hall. “Wood’s been teaching 
us new moves.” He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the 
ground, soaring up into the air. The cool morning air 
whipped his face, waking him far more effectively 
than Wood’s long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on 
the Quidditch field. He soared right around the 
stadium at full speed, racing Fred and George. Page | 121 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling “What’s that funny clicking noise?” called Fred as 
they hurtled around the corner. Harry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one 
of the highest seats, his camera raised, taking picture 
after picture, the sound strangely magnified in the 
deserted stadium. “Look this way, Harry! This way!” he cried shrilly. 
“Who’s that?” said Fred. “No idea,” Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that 
took him as far away as possible from Colin. “What’s going on?” said Wood, frowning, as he 
skimmed through the air toward them. “Why’s that 
first year taking pictures? I don’t like it. He could be a 
Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new 
training program.” “He’s in Gryffindor,” said Harry quickly. “And the Slytherins don’t need a spy, Oliver,” said 
George. “What makes you say that?” said Wood testily. “Because they’re here in person,” said George, 
pointing. Several people in green robes were walking onto the 
field, broomsticks in their hands. “I don’t believe it!” Wood hissed in outrage. “I booked 
the field for today! We’ll see about this!” Page | 122 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling Wood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder 
than he meant to in his anger, staggering slightly as 
he dismounted. Harry, Fred, and George followed. “Flint!” Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. “This 
is our practice time! We got up specially! You can 
clear off now!” Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a 
look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied, 
“Plenty of room for all of us, Wood.” Angelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There 
were no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood 
shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering 
to a man. “But I booked the field!” said Wood, positively spitting 
with rage. “I booked it!” “Ah,” said Flint. “But Tve got a specially signed note 
here from Professor Snape. % Professor S. Snape, give 
the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the 
Quidditch field owinq to the need to train their new 
Seeker. ’ ” “You’ve got a new Seeker?” said Wood, distracted. 
“Where?” And from behind the six large figures before them 
came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his 
pale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy. “Aren’t you Lucius Malfoy’s son?” said Fred, looking 
at Malfoy with dislike. “Funny you should mention Draco’s father,” said Flint 
as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly. Page | 123 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling “Let me show you the generous gift he’s made to the 
Slytherin team.” All seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven 
highly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of 
fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two 
Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors’ 
noses in the early morning sun. “Very latest model. Only came out last month,” said 
Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end 
of his own. “I believe it outstrips the old Two 
Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the 
old Cleansweeps” — he smiled nastily at Fred and 
George, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives — 
“sweeps the board with them.” None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything 
to say for a moment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly 
his cold eyes were reduced to slits. “Oh, look,” said Flint. “A field invasion.” Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see 
what was going on. “What’s happening?” Ron asked Harry. “Why aren’t 
you playing? And what’s he doing here?” He was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin 
Quidditch robes. “I’m the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,” said Malfoy, 
smugly. “Everyone’s just been admiring the brooms 
my father’s bought our team.” Ron gaped, openmouthed, at the seven superb 
broomsticks in front of him. Page | 124 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling “Good, aren’t they?” said Malfoy smoothly. “But 
perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some 
gold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off 
those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would 
bid for them.” The Slytherin team howled with laughter. “At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy 
their way in,” said Hermione sharply. “They got in on 
pure talent.” The smug look on Malfoy’s face flickered. “No one asked your opinion, you filthy little 
Mudblood,” he spat. Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something 
really bad because there was an instant uproar at his 
words. Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred 
and George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, “How 
dare you\”, and Ron plunged his hand into his robes, 
pulled out his wand, yelling, “You’ll pay for that one, 
Malfoy!” and pointed it furiously under Flint’s arm at 
Malfoy’s face. A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of 
green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron’s wand, 
hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling 
backward onto the grass. “Ron! Ron! Are you all right?” squealed Hermione. Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came 
out. Instead he gave an almighty belch and several 
slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap. The Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. Flint was doubled up, hanging onto his new Page | 125 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling broomstick for support. Malfoy was on all fours, 
banging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors were 
gathered around Ron, who kept belching large, 
glistening slugs. Nobody seemed to want to touch 
him. “We’d better get him to Hagrid’s, it’s nearest,” said 
Harry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair 
of them pulled Ron up by the arms. “What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill? 
But you can cure him, can’t you?” Colin had run 
down from his seat and was now dancing alongside 
them as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heave and 
more slugs dribbled down his front. “Oooh,” said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. 
“Can you hold him still, Harry?” “Get out of the way, Colin!” said Harry angrily. He and 
Hermione supported Ron out of the stadium and 
across the grounds toward the edge of the forest. “Nearly there, Ron,” said Hermione as the 
gamekeeper’s cabin came into view. “You’ll be all right 
in a minute — almost there — ” They were within twenty feet of Hagrid’s house when 
the front door opened, but it wasn’t Hagrid who 
emerged. Gilderoy Lockhart, wearing robes of palest 
mauve today, came striding out. “Quick, behind here,” Harry hissed, dragging Ron 
behind a nearby bush. Hermione followed, somewhat 
reluctantly. “It’s a simple matter if you know what you’re doing!” 
Lockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid. “If you need 
help, you know where I am! I’ll let you have a copy of Page | 126 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling my book. I’m surprised you haven’t already got one — 
I’ll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!” 
And he strode away toward the castle. Harry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then 
pulled Ron out of the bush and up to Hagrid’s front 
door. They knocked urgently. Hagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but 
his expression brightened when he saw who it was. “Bin wonderin’ when you’d come ter see me — come 
in, come in — thought you mighta bin Professor 
Lockhart back again — ” Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the 
threshold into the one-roomed cabin, which had an 
enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily 
in the other. Hagrid didn’t seem perturbed by Ron’s 
slug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he 
lowered Ron into a chair. “Better out than in,” he said cheerfully, plunking a 
large copper basin in front of him. “Get ’em all up, 
Ron.” “I don’t think there’s anything to do except wait for it 
to stop,” said Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend 
over the basin. “That’s a difficult curse to work at the 
best of times, but with a broken wand — ” Hagrid was bustling around making them tea. His 
boarhound, Fang, was slobbering over Harry. “What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?” Harry 
asked, scratching Fang’s ears. “Givin’ me advice on gettin’ kelpies out of a well,” 
growled Hagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off his Page | 127 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling scrubbed table and setting down the teapot. “Like I 
don’ know. An’ bangin’ on about some banshee he 
banished. If one word of it was true, I’ll eat my kettle.” It was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts 
teacher, and Harry looked at him in surprise. 
Hermione, however, said in a voice somewhat higher 
than usual, “I think you’re being a bit unfair. Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the 
best man for the job — ” “He was the on’y man for the job,” said Hagrid, 
offering them a plate of treacle toffee, while Ron 
coughed squelchily into his basin. “An’ I mean the 
on’y one. Gettin’ very difficult ter find anyone fer the 
Dark Arts job. People aren’t too keen ter take it on, 
see. They’re startin’ ter think it’s jinxed. No one’s 
lasted long fer a while now. So tell me,” said Hagrid, 
jerking his head at Ron. “Who was he tryin’ ter 
curse?” “Malfoy called Hermione something — it must’ve been 
really bad, because everyone went wild.” “It was bad,” said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the 
tabletop looking pale and sweaty. “Malfoy called her 
‘Mudblood,’ Hagrid — ” Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs 
made their appearance. Hagrid looked outraged. “He didn’!” he growled at Hermione. “He did,” she said. “But I don’t know what it means. I 
could tell it was really rude, of course — ” “It’s about the most insulting thing he could think of,” 
gasped Ron, coming back up. “Mudblood’s a really 
foul name for someone who is Muggle-born — you Page | 128 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling know, non-magic parents. There are some wizards — 
like Malfoy’s family — who think they’re better than 
everyone else because they’re what people call pure- 
blood.” He gave a small burp, and a single slug fell 
into his outstretched hand. He threw it into the basin 
and continued, “I mean, the rest of us know it doesn’t 
make any difference at all. Look at Neville Longbottom 
— he’s pure-blood and he can hardly stand a 
cauldron the right way up.” “An’ they haven’t invented a spell our Hermione can’ 
do,” said Hagrid proudly, making Hermione go a 
brilliant shade of magenta. “It’s a disgusting thing to call someone,” said Ron, 
wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand. “Dirty 
blood, see. Common blood. It’s ridiculous. Most 
wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we 
hadn’t married Muggles we’d’ve died out.” He retched and ducked out of sight again. “Well, I don’ blame yeh fer tryin’ ter curse him, Ron,” 
said Hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs 
hitting the basin. “Bu’ maybe it was a good thing yer 
wand backfired. ’Spect Lucius Malfoy would’ve come 
marchin’ up ter school if yeh’d cursed his son. Least 
yer not in trouble.” Harry would have pointed out that trouble didn’t 
come much worse than having slugs pouring out of 
your mouth, but he couldn’t; Hagrid’s treacle toffee 
had cemented his jaws together. “Harry,” said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a 
sudden thought. “Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I’ve 
heard you’ve bin givin’ out signed photos. How come I 
haven’t got one?” Page | 129 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling Furious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart. “I have not been giving out signed photos,” he said 
hotly. “If Lockhart’s still spreading that around — ” But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing. “I’m on’y jokin’,” he said, patting Harry genially on the 
back and sending him face first into the table. “I knew 
yeh hadn’t really. I told Lockhart yeh didn’ need teh. 
Yer more famous than him without tryin’.” “Bet he didn’t like that,” said Harry, sitting up and 
rubbing his chin. “Don’ think he did,” said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling. 
“An’ then I told him I’d never read one o’ his books an’ 
he decided ter go. Treacle toffee, Ron?” he added as 
Ron reappeared. “No thanks,” said Ron weakly. “Better not risk it.” “Come an’ see what I’ve bin growin’,” said Hagrid as 
Harry and Hermione finished the last of their tea. In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid ’s house 
were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever 
seen. Each was the size of a large boulder. “Gettin’ on well, aren’t they?” said Hagrid happily. “Fer the Halloween feast ... should be big enough by 
then.” “What’ve you been feeding them?” said Harry. Hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they 
were alone. Page | 130 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling “Well, I’ve bin givin’ them — you know — a bit o’ help Harry noticed Hagrid’s flowery pink umbrella leaning 
against the back wall of the cabin. Harry had had 
reason to believe before now that this umbrella was 
not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong impression 
that Hagrid’s old school wand was concealed inside it. 
Hagrid wasn’t supposed to use magic. He had been 
expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry 
had never found out why — any mention of the 
matter and Hagrid would clear his throat loudly and 
become mysteriously deaf until the subject was 
changed. “An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?” said Hermione, 
halfway between disapproval and amusement. “Well, 
you’ve done a good job on them.” “That’s what yer little sister said,” said Hagrid, 
nodding at Ron. “Met her jus’ yesterday.” Hagrid 
looked sideways at Harry, his beard twitching. “Said 
she was jus’ lookin’ round the grounds, but I reckon 
she was hopin’ she might run inter someone else at 
my house.” He winked at Harry. “If yeh ask me, she 
wouldn’ say no ter a signed — ” “Oh, shut up,” said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter 
and the ground was sprayed with slugs. “Watch it!” Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his 
precious pumpkins. It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had 
one bit of treacle toffee since dawn, he was keen to go 
back to school to eat. They said good-bye to Hagrid 
and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing 
occasionally, but only bringing up two very small 
slugs. Page | 131 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall 
when a voice rang out, “There you are, Potter — 
Weasley.” Professor McGonagall was walking toward 
them, looking stern. “You will both do your detentions 
this evening.” “What’re we doing, Professor?” said Ron, nervously 
suppressing a burp. “ You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room 
with Mr. Filch,” said Professor McGonagall. “And no 
magic, Weasley — elbow grease.” Ron gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed 
by every student in the school. “And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart 
answer his fan mail,” said Professor McGonagall. “Oh n — Professor, can’t I go and do the trophy room, 
too?” said Harry desperately. “Certainly not,” said Professor McGonagall, raising 
her eyebrows. “Professor Lockhart requested you 
particularly. Eight o’clock sharp, both of you.” Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states 
of deepest gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a 
well-you-did-break-school-rules sort of expression. 
Harry didn’t enjoy his shepherd’s pie as much as he’d 
thought. Both he and Ron felt they’d got the worse 
deal. “Filch ’ll have me there all night,” said Ron heavily. “No magic! There must be about a hundred cups in 
that room. I’m no good at Muggle cleaning.” Page | 132 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling “I’d swap anytime,” said Harry hollowly. “I’ve had 
loads of practice with the Dursleys. Answering 
Lockhart’s fan mail ... he’ll be a nightmare. ...” Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what 
seemed like no time, it was five minutes to eight, and 
Harry was dragging his feet along the second-floor 
corridor to Lockhart’s office. He gritted his teeth and 
knocked. The door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at 
him. “Ah, here’s the scalawag!” he said. “Come in, Harry, 
come in — ” Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many 
candles were countless framed photographs of 
Lockhart. He had even signed a few of them. Another 
large pile lay on his desk. “You can address the envelopes!” Lockhart told Harry, 
as though this was a huge treat. “This first one’s to 
Gladys Gudgeon, bless her — huge fan of mine — ” The minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart’s voice 
wash over him, occasionally saying, “Mmm” and 
“Right” and “Yeah.” Now and then he caught a phrase 
like, “Fame’s a fickle friend, Harry,” or “Celebrity is as 
celebrity does, remember that.” The candles burned lower and lower, making the light 
dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart 
watching him. Harry moved his aching hand over 
what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out 
Veronica Smethley’s address. It must be nearly time to 
leave, Harry thought miserably, please let it be nearly 
time. ... Page | 133 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling And then he heard something — something quite 
apart from the spitting of the dying candles and 
Lockhart’s prattle about his fans. It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a 
voice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom. “Come ... come to me. ... Let me rip you. ... Let me tear 
you. ... Let me kill you. ...” Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot 
appeared on Veronica Smethley’s street. “What?” he said loudly. “I know!” said Lockhart. “Six solid months at the top 
of the best-seller list! Broke all records!” “No,” said Harry frantically. “That voice!” “Sorry?” said Lockhart, looking puzzled. “What voice?” “That — that voice that said — didn’t you hear it?” Lockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment. “What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you’re 
getting a little drowsy? Great Scott — look at the time! 
“We’ve been here nearly four hours! I’d never have 
believed it — the time’s flown, hasn’t it?” Harry didn’t answer. He was straining his ears to hear 
the voice again, but there was no sound now except 
for Lockhart telling him he mustn’t expect a treat like 
this every time he got detention. Feeling dazed, Harry 
left. It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was 
almost empty. Harry went straight up to the Page | 134 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling dormitory. Ron wasn’t back yet. Harry pulled on his 
pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later, 
Ron arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a 
strong smell of polish into the darkened room. “My muscles have all seized up,” he groaned, sinking 
on his bed. “Fourteen times he made me buff up that 
Quidditch Cup before he was satisfied. And then I 
had another slug attack all over a Special Award for 
Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off. . . . How was it with Lockhart?” Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, 
and Seamus, Harry told Ron exactly what he had 
heard. “And Lockhart said he couldn’t hear it?” said Ron. 
Harry could see him frowning in the moonlight. “D’you think he was lying? But I don’t get it — even 
someone invisible would’ve had to open the door.” “I know,” said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and 
staring at the canopy above him. “I don’t get it either.” Page | 135 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling d THE DEATHDAY PARTY October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the 
grounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the 
nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds 
among the staff and students. Her Pepperup Potion 
worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking 
at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny 
Weasley, who had been looking pale, was bullied into 
taking some by Percy. The steam pouring from under 
her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole 
head was on fire. Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle 
windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower 
beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid’s 
pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver 
Wood’s enthusiasm for regular training sessions, 
however, was not dampened, which was why Harry 
was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon 
a few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor 
Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud. 
Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn’t been a 
happy practice session. Fred and George, who had 
Page | 136 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for 
themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two 
Thousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin 
team was no more than seven greenish blurs, 
shooting through the air like missiles. As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he 
came across somebody who looked just as 
preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the 
ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of 
a window, muttering under his breath, "... don’t fulfill 
their requirements ... half an inch, if that ...” “Hello, Nick,” said Harry. “Hello, hello,” said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and 
looking round. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his 
long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which 
concealed the fact that his neck was almost 
completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry 
could see right through him to the dark sky and 
torrential rain outside. “You look troubled, young Potter,” said Nick, folding a 
transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside 
his doublet. “So do you,” said Harry. “Ah,” Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, “a 
matter of no importance. ... It’s not as though I really 
wanted to join. ... Thought I’d apply, but apparently I 
‘don’t fulfill requirements’ — ” In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great 
bitterness on his face. “But you would think, wouldn’t you,” he erupted 
suddenly, pulling the letter back out of his pocket, Page | 137 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling “that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a 
blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless 
Hunt?” “Oh — yes,” said Harry, who was obviously supposed 
to agree. “I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all 
been quick and clean, and my head had come off 
properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal 
of pain and ridicule. However — ” Nearly Headless 
Nick shook his letter open and read furiously: “ ‘We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have 
parted company with their bodies. You will appreciate 
that it would be impossible otherwise for members to 
participate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head- 
Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret, 
therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill 
our requirements. With very best wishes, Sir Patrick 
Delaney -Podmore.’ ” Fuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away. “Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, 
Harry! Most people would think that’s good and 
beheaded, but oh, no, it’s not enough for Sir Properly 
Decapitated-Podmore . ” Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and 
then said, in a far calmer tone, “So — what’s 
bothering you? Anything I can do?” “No,” said Harry. “Not unless you know where we can 
get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for 
our match against Sly — ” The rest of Harry’s sentence was drowned out by a 
high-pitched mewling from somewhere near his Page | 138 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing into 
a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the 
skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his endless battle 
against students. “You’d better get out of here, Harry,” said Nick 
quickly. “Filch isn’t in a good mood — he’s got the flu 
and some third years accidentally plastered frog 
brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He’s been 
cleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud 
all over the place — ” “Right,” said Harry, backing away from the accusing 
stare of Mrs. Norris, but not quickly enough. Drawn 
to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to 
connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst 
suddenly through a tapestry to Harry’s right, 
wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule- 
breaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around 
his head, and his nose was unusually purple. “Filth!” he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes 
popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy 
puddle that had dripped from Harry’s Quidditch 
robes. “Mess and muck everywhere! I’ve had enough 
of it, I tell you! Follow me, Potter!” So Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless 
Nick and followed Filch back downstairs, doubling the 
number of muddy footprints on the floor. Harry had never been inside Filch’s office before; it 
was a place most students avoided. The room was 
dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp 
dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried 
fish lingered about the place. Wooden filing cabinets 
stood around the walls; from their labels, Harry could 
see that they contained details of every pupil Filch 
Page | 139 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling had ever punished. Fred and George Weasley had an 
entire drawer to themselves. A highly polished 
collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall 
behind Filch’s desk. It was common knowledge that 
he was always begging Dumbledore to let him 
suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling. Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and 
began shuffling around looking for parchment. “Dung,” he muttered furiously, “great sizzling dragon 
bogies ... frog brains ... rat intestines ... I’ve had 
enough of it ... make an example ... where’s the form 
... yes ...” He retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk 
drawer and stretched it out in front of him, dipping 
his long black quill into the ink pot. “ Name ... Harry Potter. Crime ...” “It was only a bit of mud!” said Harry. “It’s only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it’s an 
extra hour scrubbing!” shouted Filch, a drip shivering 
unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose. “Crime 
... befouling the castle ... suggested sentence ...” Dabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted 
unpleasantly at Harry, who waited with bated breath 
for his sentence to fall. But as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great 
BANG! on the ceiling of the office, which made the oil 
lamp rattle. “PEEVES!” Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a 
transport of rage. “I’ll have you this time, I’ll have 
you!” Page | 140 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets- J.K. Rowling And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran 
flat-footed from the office, Mrs. Norris streaking 
alongside him. Peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne 
menace who lived to cause havoc and distress. Harry 
didn’t much like Peeves, but couldn’t help feeling 
grateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves 
had done (and it sounded as though he’d wrecked 
something very big this time) would distract Filch 
from Harry. Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to 
come back, Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next 
to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart from 
his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple 
envelope with silver lettering on the front. With a 
quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn’t on 
his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read: KWIKSPELL A Correspondence Course in Beginners’ Magic Intrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled 
out the sheaf of parchment inside. More curly silver 
writing on the front page said: Feel out of step in the world of modern magic? Find 
yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells? 
Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork? There is an answer! Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy- 
learn course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have 
benefited from the Kwikspell method! Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: Page | 141 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling “I had no memory for incantations and my potions 
were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am 
the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the 
recipe of my Scintillation Solution!” Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: “My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one 
month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I 
succeeded in turning her into a yak! Thank you, Kwikspell!” Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the 
envelope’s contents. Why on earth did Filch want a 
Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn’t a proper 
wizard? Harry was just reading “Lesson One: Holding 
Your Wand (Some Useful Tips)” when shuffling 
footsteps outside told him Filch was coming back. 
Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry 
threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened. Filch was looking triumphant. “That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!” he 
was saying gleefully to Mrs. Norris. “We’ll have Peeves 
out this time, my sweet — ” His eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the 
Kwikspell envelope, which, Harry realized too late, 
was lying two feet away from where it had started. Filch ’s pasty face went brick red. Harry braced 
himself for a tidal wave of fury. Filch hobbled across 
to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it 
into a drawer. “Have you — did you read — ?” he sputtered. Page | 142 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling “No,” Harry lied quickly. Filch ’s knobbly hands were twisting together. “If I thought you’d read my private — not that it’s 
mine — for a friend — be that as it may — however — Harry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never 
looked madder. His eyes were popping, a tic was 
going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan 
scarf didn’t help. “Very well — go — and don’t breathe a word — not 
that — however, if you didn’t read — go now, I have to 
write up Peeves’ report — go — ” Amazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up 
the corridor, and back upstairs. To escape from 
Filch ’s office without punishment was probably some 
kind of school record. “Harry! Harry! Did it work?” Nearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom. 
Behind him, Harry could see the wreckage of a large 
black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been 
dropped from a great height. “I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch’s 
office,” said Nick eagerly. “Thought it might distract 
him — ” “Was that you?” said Harry gratefully. “Yeah, it 
worked, I didn’t even get detention. Thanks, Nick!” They set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless 
Nick, Harry noticed, was still holding Sir Patrick’s 
rejection letter. Page | 143 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling “I wish there was something I could do for you about 
the Headless Hunt,” Harry said. Nearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry 
walked right through him. He wished he hadn’t; it 
was like stepping through an icy shower. “But there is something you could do for me,” said 
Nick excitedly. “Harry — would I be asking too much 
— but no, you wouldn’t want — ” “What is it?” said Harry. “Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth 
deathday,” said Nearly Headless Nick, drawing 
himself up and looking dignified. “Oh,” said Harry, not sure whether he should look 
sorry or happy about this. “Right.” “I’m holding a party down in one of the roomier 
dungeons. Friends will be coming from all over the 
country. It would be such an honor if you would 
attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most 
welcome, too, of course — but I daresay you’d rather 
go to the school feast?” He watched Harry on 
tenterhooks. “No,” said Harry quickly, “I’ll come — ” “My dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party! 
And” — he hesitated, looking excited — “do you think 
you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick how very 
frightening and impressive you find me?” “Of — of course,” said Harry. Nearly Headless Nick beamed at him. Page | 144 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling “A deathday party?” said Hermione keenly when 
Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in 
the common room. “I bet there aren’t many living 
people who can say they’ve been to one of those — it’ll 
be fascinating!” “Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they 
died?” said Ron, who was halfway through his Potions 
homework and grumpy. “Sounds dead depressing to 
me....” Rain was still lashing the windows, which were now 
inky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful. 
The firelight glowed over the countless squashy 
armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing 
homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, 
trying to find out what would happen if you fed a 
Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had 
“rescued” the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard 
from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was 
now smoldering gently on a table surrounded by a 
knot of curious people. Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione 
about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the 
salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting 
loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the 
room. The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at 
Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine 
stars showering from the salamander’s mouth, and its 
escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, 
drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from 
Harry’s mind. By the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting 
his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest 
of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween 
feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the 
usual live bats, Hagrid’s vast pumpkins had been 
Page | 145 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit 
in, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had 
booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the 
entertainment. “A promise is a promise,” Hermione reminded Harry 
bossily. “You said you’d go to the deathday party.” So at seven o’clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked 
straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, 
which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and 
candles, and directed their steps instead toward the 
dungeons. The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick’s 
party had been lined with candles, too, though the 
effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, 
jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a 
dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The 
temperature dropped with every step they took. As 
Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around 
him, he heard what sounded like a thousand 
fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard. “Is that supposed to be music?” Ron whispered. They 
turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick 
standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes. “My dear friends,” he said mournfully. “Welcome, 
welcome ... so pleased you could come. ...” He swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside. It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of 
hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly 
drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the 
dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, 
played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped 
platform. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue 
Page | 146 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling with a thousand more black candles. Their breath 
rose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a 
freezer. “Shall we have a look around?” Harry suggested, 
wanting to warm up his feet. “Careful not to walk through anyone,” said Ron 
nervously, and they set off around the edge of the 
dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a 
ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a 
cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight 
with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry 
wasn’t surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a 
gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver 
bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the 
other ghosts. “Oh, no,” said Hermione, stopping abruptly. “Turn 
back, turn back, I don’t want to talk to Moaning 
Myrtle — ” “Who?” said Harry as they backtracked quickly. “She haunts one of the toilets in the girls’ bathroom 
on the first floor,” said Hermione. “She haunts a toilet ?” “Yes. It’s been out-of-order all year because she keeps 
having tantrums and flooding the place. I never went 
in there anyway if I could avoid it; it’s awful trying to 
have a pee with her wailing at you — ” “Look, food!” said Ron. On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, 
also covered in black velvet. They approached it 
eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks, Page | 147 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, 
rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; 
cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on 
salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of 
cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of 
place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a 
tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, SIR NICHOLAS DE MIMSY-PORPINGTON 
DIED 3 1 ST OCTOBER, 1 492 Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached 
the table, crouched low, and walked through it, his 
mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the 
stinking salmon. “Can you taste it if you walk through it?” Harry asked 
him. “Almost,” said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away. “I expect they’ve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,” 
said Hermione knowledgeably, pinching her nose and 
leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis. “Can we move? I feel sick,” said Ron. They had barely turned around, however, when a 
little man swooped suddenly from under the table and 
came to a halt in midair before them. “Hello, Peeves,” said Harry cautiously. Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist 
was the very reverse of pale and transparent. He was 
wearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow tie, 
and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face. Page | 148 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling “Nibbles?” he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of 
peanuts covered in fungus. “No thanks,” said Hermione. “Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,” said Peeves, 
his eyes dancing. “Rude you was about poor Myrtle.” 
He took a deep breath and bellowed, “OY! MYRTLE!” “Oh, no, Peeves, don’t tell her what I said, she’ll be 
really upset,” Hermione whispered frantically. “I didn’t 
mean it, I don’t mind her — er, hello, Myrtle.” The squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the 
glummest face Harry had ever seen, half-hidden 
behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles. “What?” she said sulkily. “How are you, Myrtle?” said Hermione in a falsely 
bright voice. “It’s nice to see you out of the toilet.” Myrtle sniffed. “Miss Granger was just talking about you — ” said 
Peeves slyly in Myrtle’s ear. “Just saying — saying — how nice you look tonight,” 
said Hermione, glaring at Peeves. Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously. “You’re making fun of me,” she said, silver tears 
welling rapidly in her small, see-through eyes. “No — honestly — didn’t I just say how nice Myrtle’s 
looking?” said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron 
painfully in the ribs. Page | 149 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling “Oh, yeah — ” “She did — ” “Don’t lie to me,” Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding 
down her face, while Peeves chuckled happily over her 
shoulder. “D’you think I don’t know what people call 
me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle! 
Miserable, moaning, moping Myrtle!” “You’ve forgotten pimply,” Peeves hissed in her ear. Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled 
from the dungeon. Peeves shot after her, pelting her 
with moldy peanuts, yelling, “Pimply\ Pimplyl” “Oh, dear,” said Hermione sadly. Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them 
through the crowd. “Enjoying yourselves?” “Oh, yes,” they lied. “Not a bad turnout,” said Nearly Headless Nick 
proudly. “The Wailing Widow came all the way up 
from Kent. ... It’s nearly time for my speech, I’d better 
go and warn the orchestra. ...” The orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very 
moment. They, and everyone else in the dungeon, fell 
silent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting 
horn sounded. “Oh, here we go,” said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly. Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost 
horses, each ridden by a headless horseman. The Page | 150 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too, 
but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick’s face. The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor 
and halted, rearing and plunging. At the front of the 
pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head 
under his arm, from which position he was blowing 
the horn. The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high 
in the air so he could see over the crowd (everyone 
laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick, 
squashing his head back onto his neck. “Nick!” he roared. “How are you? Head still hanging in 
there?” He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless 
Nick on the shoulder. “Welcome, Patrick,” said Nick stiffly. “Live ’uns!” said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione and giving a huge, fake jump of 
astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the 
crowd howled with laughter). “Very amusing,” said Nearly Headless Nick darkly. “Don’t mind Nick!” shouted Sir Patrick’s head from 
the floor. “Still upset we won’t let him join the Hunt! 
But I mean to say — look at the fellow — ” “I think,” said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look 
from Nick, “Nick’s very — frightening and — er — ” “Ha!” yelled Sir Patrick’s head. “Bet he asked you to 
say that!” “If I could have everyone’s attention, it’s time for my 
speech!” said Nearly Headless Nick loudly, striding Page | 151 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue 
spotlight. “My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is 
my great sorrow ...” But nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the 
rest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of 
Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch. 
Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his 
audience, but gave up as Sir Patrick’s head went 
sailing past him to loud cheers. Harry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry. “I can’t stand much more of this,” Ron muttered, his 
teeth chattering, as the orchestra ground back into 
action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance 
floor. “Let’s go,” Harry agreed. They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming 
at anyone who looked at them, and a minute later 
were hurrying back up the passageway full of black 
candles. “Pudding might not be finished yet,” said Ron 
hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the 
entrance hall. And then Harry heard it. "... rip ... tear ... kill ...” It was the same voice, the same cold, murderous 
voice he had heard in Lockhart’s office. Page | 152 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling He stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, 
listening with all his might, looking around, squinting 
up and down the dimly lit passageway. “Harry, what’re you — ?” “It’s that voice again — shut up a minute — ” soo hungry ... for so long ...” “Listen!” said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione 
froze, watching him. “... kill ... time to kill ...” The voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was 
moving away — moving upward. A mixture of fear and 
excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark 
ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a 
phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn’t matter? “This way,” he shouted, and he began to run, up the 
stairs, into the entrance hall. It was no good hoping to 
hear anything here, the babble of talk from the 
Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. 
Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first 
floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him. “Harry, what’re we — ” “SHH!” Harry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor 
above, and growing fainter still, he heard the voice: 
“...I smell blood. ...I SMELL BLOOD\” His stomach lurched — Page | 153 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling “It’s going to kill someone!” he shouted, and ignoring 
Ron’s and Hermione’s bewildered faces, he ran up the 
next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen 
over his own pounding footsteps — Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, 
Ron and Hermione panting behind him, not stopping 
until they turned a corner into the last, deserted 
passage. “Harry, what was that all about?” said Ron, wiping 
sweat off his face. “I couldn’t hear anything. ...” But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the 
corridor. “Loo/c!” Something was shining on the wall ahead. They 
approached slowly, squinting through the darkness. 
Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall 
between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by 
the flaming torches. THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. 
ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE. “What’s that thing — hanging underneath?” said Ron, 
a slight quiver in his voice. As they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped — there 
was a large puddle of water on the floor; Ron and 
Hermione grabbed him, and they inched toward the 
message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All 
three of them realized what it was at once, and leapt 
backward with a splash. Page | 154 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling Mrs. Norris, the caretaker’s cat, was hanging by her 
tail from the torch bracket. She was stiff as a board, 
her eyes wide and staring. For a few seconds, they didn’t move. Then Ron said, 
“Let’s get out of here.” “Shouldn’t we try and help — ” Harry began 
awkwardly. “Trust me,” said Ron. “We don’t want to be found 
here.” But it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant 
thunder, told them that the feast had just ended. 
From either end of the corridor where they stood 
came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the 
stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; 
next moment, students were crashing into the 
passage from both ends. The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as 
the people in front spotted the hanging cat. Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the 
corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students 
pressing forward to see the grisly sight. Then someone shouted through the quiet. “Enemies of the Heir, beware! You’ll be next, 
Mudbloods!” It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of 
the crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually bloodless 
face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the 
hanging, immobile cat. Page | 155 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling
